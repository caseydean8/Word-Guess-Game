# Word-Guess-Game
This is a javascript based hangman style word guess game. 
The player has 10 attempts to key in the letter of short word.
If the player is successful, a Win is recorded and game resets.
If the player fails, the word is revealed and game resets.
Eventually the game is intended to have a Game of Thrones theme.
